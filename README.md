# Performing analysis on kickstarter to uncover trends
# Overview
	In the attached spreadsheet there is kickstarter funding data, and Louise is looking for trends in theater arts kickstarter. She needs to gather data so she can set an accurate goal for her kickstarter and find the most successful date range for her to release it so her kickstarter can be successful. 
Analysis
	The best time for Louise to release her kickstarter would be in May. Based on the data in the sheet “theater outcomes by start date” the percentage of theater performances starts to see a noticeable increase going into April. Then the peak of the successful theater kickstarters happens in May then the decline starts, but it tapers off until August where the success rate drops below Aprils success rate. 

 
	There are limitations on this chart though such as the number of kick starters varies from month to month. So, in may not only was there an increase in success rate but there was also an increase in the Failure rate. It might be more accurate to look at percentage rates of success/failure over the same time periods. This would give us a more accurate analysis because the varying amount theater kickstarters. Additionally, the data is dependent on what year the kickstarters took place. There may have been more theater kickstarters in some years than others and this could very well be caused due to a temporary increase in the demand for theater shows that tapered off after that trend has worn off. 
	Our second chart for outcomes based on goals can be very misleading.
 
	This chart shows that the highest success rate of theater kickstarters was in the goal range of 35,000 – 40,000. But the amount of kickstarters with goals that high are few and far between. We can conclude that the information portraid in the graph may be skewed thus not the most reliable source of information. 
Results
	We can conclude that Louise should release her kickstarter within the range of April-May because throughout the data we are provided those months have the best success rate and should not do a rollout date from august on. She should also have her goal within the range of 5,000 – 10,000 because those are the ranges with the best success to total ratio.
